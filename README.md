__Project : Image-Converter-GUI-with-Python

To create an Image converter GUI with Python, I will use the Tkinter library in Python which is the best known Python framework for building GUI application. Other than Tkinter we also need PIL library in Python which stands for Python Imaging Library.

It will work the same as all other applications installed in your system. 

###### Steps to be followed :

1. You first need to select a PNG file then click on the button to convert PNG to JPG. 
2. Then you just need to select a folder where you want to save your converted image. 

This is how we can easily create a GUI application to convert Images. I hope you liked this project on how to build an Image conversion GUI with Python programming language.
